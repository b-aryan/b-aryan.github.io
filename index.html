                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hey there! I'm Aryan Bhushanwar, a proud Nagpurkar with a heart full of dreams and a mind buzzing with ideas. I recently wrapped up my B.Tech in Electronics and Electrical Engineering from the prestigious <a href="https://www.iitg.ac.in/">IIT Guwahati</a>, where I honed my skills in circuits, signals, and everything in between. But let's be real---while I loved my time there, my true passion lies in the world of Machine Learning.</p>
                
                <p>Currently, I'm navigating the corporate world as a Manager at Tata Steel, where I've learned the ropes of leadership and strategic thinking. But deep down, I'm a techie at heart, always itching to dive into the fascinating realm of algorithms, data, and AI. So, I'm on a mission to pivot my career and make Machine Learning my new playground.</p>

                <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
                <p>When I'm not geeking out over neural networks or managing projects, you'll find me curled up with a good Sci-Fi novel. There's something magical about getting lost in a world of futuristic tech and interstellar adventures. And if you ever visit my place, you'll be greeted by my furry companions---my beloved cats who keep me company and remind me that life's little moments are just as important as the big ones.</p>

                <p>I believe in the power of innovation, the joy of learning, and the importance of staying curious. Whether it's tinkering with code or cuddling with my cats, I'm always up for a challenge and a good laugh. So, if you're into tech, books, or just want to chat about the latest Sci-Fi flick, hit me up! Let's connect and create something amazing together.</p>
